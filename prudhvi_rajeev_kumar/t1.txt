Hi All

Object-Oriented Programming in Python is a way of organizing code so that it models real-world concepts. A class acts like a blueprint that defines the properties and behaviors of something, while an object is a specific example created from that blueprint. For instance, if you have a Car class with attributes like brand and color and methods like drive, you can create different car objects such as a red Tesla or a blue BMW. Each object has its own unique details but follows the same structure defined by the class. This approach makes programs easier to understand, reuse, and maintain.
