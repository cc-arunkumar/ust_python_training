"""
Objective:
Sometimes we need fixed information that doesn’t come from the user, like a default project name.

Requirements:
Create a function that returns the current active project name, e.g., "UST Cloud
Migration" .
The function should not accept any parameters.
It should just return the value to the main program.

def current_project_name():
    return "UST Cloud Migration"

print(current_project_name())

# SAMPLE OUTPUT
 
 
"""UST Cloud Migration"""
