"""
Objective:

When the program starts, it should display a small welcome message for the user.
This message doesn’t depend on any input from the user — it will always remain
the same.

Requirements:
Create a function that prints a welcome message like:
“Welcome to UST Employee Work Report System”
“This program helps HR calculate employee performance easily.”
The function should not take any parameters.
It should only display the message and not return anything

"""

def welcome():   # Function to display welcome message
    print("Welcome to UST EMployee Work Report System")   # Print main welcome line
    print("This Program helps HR Calculate employee performance salary")   # Print description message

welcome()   # Call the function to display the welcome message


# SAMPLE OUTPUT
"""
